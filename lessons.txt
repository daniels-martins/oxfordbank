Facades vs Illuminate/library/resource
e.g Request facades vs Illuminate/Http/Request

You cannot create an instance of a facade, 
Facades are there only for you to use as a portal to access all the properties 
of a resource eg. (Request)
so Request::all() from a facade will work
whereas doing this from a Illuminate\Http\Request would return false 
because all() is not a static method.
